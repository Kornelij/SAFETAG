summary: In this activity, after the core audit activities are completed, the
  auditor will create a space to share relevant information with the
  organization like the main findings, assets and processes that were included
  or excluded from the scope, pressing vulnerabilities, and recommendations
  (especially those that can be addressed right away), and next steps regarding
  the final report building and delivery.
short_summary: " "
overview: >
  Once core assessment activities are concluded, the auditor will have a better
  sense of the actual security context of the organization, and even before
  building the recommendation roadmap, will have an idea of some of the most
  relevant recommendations that will be included in the final report.


  Also, by this point, the organization might also have anticipation of knowing what the auditor found, questions like “Are we secure enough?” or “Do we need to address something ASAP because we are too vulnerable today?” are common after most of the assessment activities are over.


  To set the stage to give the organization some reassurance and potentially homework while the report is built, enabling a space to talk to them and walk them through what the auditor did will be important; this is precisely the idea behind this activity: organizing an in-person or virtual meeting with key stakeholders from the organization to, among other things, set the tone for upcoming communications, define points of contact moving forward (for the report delivery and follow-up), share what was done during the responsive support activities, and what immediate-term aspects they should address next.

Considerations`: >-
  * In many cases, this activity can be conducted in coordination with a
  training session as part of the “Responsive support” stage. So, the covered
  content can be aligned with any major vulnerabilities and recommendations
  proposed during the debrief.  

  * For some organizations receiving security audits, the debrief is even more important than the actual report because it is usually delivered in a more synchronous way and allows to be more concrete and to answer questions that the organization might have right away.
walk_through: >-
  1. **Gather the list of activities executed:** Especially those that were not
  directly observed by the organization like remote scans or desk research.


  2. **By activity, gather the list of main recommendations and vulnerabilities:** especially those that are more relevant to be addressed in the immediate and short term, or those that might have a high impact on the organization’s security.


  3. **Gather the list of things conducted in responsive support:** this could include for example group training, one-on-one help on specific topics during the interviews, configuration of services/accounts/devices, modifications made to the website with the help of IT staff if applicable, etc. Please refer to the responsive support method to get more information.


  4. **Formulate next steps:** these might include implementing specific recommendations that are urgent or require low effort, communicate with specific organizations to follow up with specialized threats, and review specific capacity building materials that will help the organization to move forward with the implementation of the roadmap.


  5. **Coordinate a call or meeting with the organization:** Ideally this space should be synchronous and will occur during or right after the core audit activity period.


  6. **During the call or meeting, share the information above:** The auditor might try to focus on specific aspects if there are many potential items to discuss, to help the organization to concentrate on the most important aspects to consider right after the audit and before receiving the final report.


  7. **Answer the questions they might have.**


  8. **Establish a communication process between now and the moment the report arrives:** This includes confirming the points of contact who will receive the report, a secure channel to deliver it, and any other potential follow-up aspects between the auditor and the organization.
recommendations: >-
  * Some auditors use this activity to facilitate a space to discuss or
  “co-create” the criteria to be followed in the implementation roadmap to be
  developed for the final report, making the audit’s final product more valuable
  to the organization and more likely to be implemented.  

  * There are various ways of executing the walk-through: some might prepare a comprehensive document and others might do a mental list. Adapt this activity to your style, skills and what you think is the best to communicate with the organization.
