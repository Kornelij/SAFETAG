summary: "A kick-off call or meeting is generally done when agreeing to conduct
  a SAFETAG assessment. Think of these meetings as a part of the assessment
  process, as you will be collecting risk information, technical information,
  and information on organizational history, culture, and important logistical
  considerations for the assessment which will inform your next actions within
  the assessment. "
short_summary: Meet with your organization and begin developing an audit plan
  while collecting contextual data and important logistical considerations for
  the assessment.
overview: Below is a recommended set of high-level topics to cover during
  initial kick-off calls or meetings. The primary goal of these meetings is to
  establish or build trust between you and the organization, and to set out
  basic logistical plans for the assessment, so use your judgment on how much
  information-gathering is possible within early meetings. The meeting should be
  natural, so use these questions as a guide, not as a strict interview
  template; you will need to formulate follow-up questions that are relevant to
  the organization. However, do not let the scheduled time over-run, so focus on
  the high-level questions and leave details to future 1-on-1 or small group
  meetings.
walk_through: >-
  You may find it helpful to copy the checklist below BEFORE the kick-off call
  and customize it based on what you already know/need to know about the
  organization and the planned assessment. 


  * ONLY if high/extreme risk/is a new connection: is there anything preventing you from having this conversation that we need to address first? For instance, are you using an appropriate communications channel for the call, or do they have concerns about the integrity of the devices they are using for the call?

  * Tell me about your organization, give me the 'elevator pitch'

  * Tell them about SAFETAG/about you, your background; build trust and share any commonalities you have with them.


  Tell them that you have some questions. Let them know that if they prefer to delay some of these topics to after an agreement is signed (if relevant) or in future meetings that is fine.


  * Tell me about your size, location, number of offices, number of staff. Overall structure of operation.

  * Why are you interested in doing this assessment? Is there a situation which makes it more relevant now?

  * What risks, threats, attacks are you experiencing? Have there been past incidents? Physical, digital, harassment, political? (If not mentioned in their answer: how are these risks experienced by individual staff?)

  * What is their management structure? What is the staff capacity for security management and especially information security? Do they have IT Staff? Do they utilize IT outsourcing?

  * Do they have policies around information security?  And more generally, what kind of organization are they: a highly structured organization with lots of formal processes, or an informal one - probably don't ask this question directly but deduce it from their responses.

  * What are their digital assets, especially potentially critical/high-risk ones? (dig deeper to discover more - and for each asset identified, try to clarify on IT staff responsibility (who should you talk to about that asset, service providers involved, etc.)

  * Go further on assets: Ask about IT infrastructure (devices, websites, servers, databases, networks) and IT security controls (antivirus subscriptions, device management, firewalls, logs, etc.)

  * Do they have social media accounts, do they have a standard/practice on password management?

  * What would they most like to get out of this process of a SAFETAG assessment?

  * Who should I work with? Who will be administrative and technical contact points?

  * Tell them what the overall assessment will look like, from their perspective, and what you need from them e.g.:
    * A risk mapping call including various stakeholders
    * Individual calls with leadership, management, technical, and admin staff
    * Spot checks on staff, devices
    * Survey for staff
    * Technical scans
    * Follow-up as needed to explore issues as discovered
    * Report & risk remediation plan
    * (If possible and funded - Remediation support)
  * Discuss timeline

  * Agree on the next steps from both sides, e.g.:
    * Lists or documentation they have 
    * Introductions to staff for interviews
    * Access to systems, if relevant, and permission to do any planned scanning (or plan to request specific permission as needed throughout the assessment)
    * Scheduling group calls, if needed
    * Do they want to have a signed agreement?
  * If needed, agree communications protocols? Email, Signal, PGP, others?
