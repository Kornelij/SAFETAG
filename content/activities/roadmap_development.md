summary: This component consists of an auditor sorting their recommendations in
  relation to the organization’s threats and capacity. The auditor prioritizes
  vulnerabilities, weighs the implementation costs of recommendations and then
  creates an actionable roadmap for the organization to make their own informed
  choices about possible next steps as they move forward.

Considerations`: >
  * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.


  * Depending on the involvement of the organization during the audit process, they might have shared priorities and aspirations in terms of security. Please have those in mind while building the roadmap, a roadmap and report that aligns well with the plans and expectations from the organization has a better chance of being followed and implemented.


  * The roadmap may be shared with local IT support, digital security trainers, possible funders, or other consultants in part, or in full. Consider the content in light of this.

    * Individual vulnerabilities should be able to be read, and acted upon, independently from the rest of the report so that the organization can easily provide only the required information for follow-up work.

  * The overall posture and risk/ranking profile components should be able to be read independent from the risk model and be free of any specific vulnerabilities to allow the organization to easily provide trusted invested parties with an overview of the results/need without exposing any specific vulnerabilities.


  * Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country or is known to surveil.


  * As a reference, based on existing literature, the organization 0xche proposes (and then adapted to the SAFETAG context by the authors of this activity) a way to understand what kind of roadmap/report the auditor should build in terms of tone, narrative, and technical depth. First, the auditor organizes the recommendations that are going to be proposed in 1- level of impact/risk and 2- urgency to implement them, and depending on potential trends, the auditor will have better guidance to continue with the process:

    * In case the recommendations are labeled as **high impact/risk and high urgency**: The product would be a **remediation report**, which is usually consumed by Incident Response teams to address known harmful vulnerabilities. Hopefully, these recommendations were shared already in the Debrief activity, so the organization can implement the recommendations while the implementation roadmap and the report are being built.

    * In case the recommendations are labeled as **high impact/risk and low urgency**: The product would be a **strategic report**, which is usually consumed by the organization’s directors and other high-level decision-making staff, because carrying out the recommendations usually requires considerable financial resources, managerial buy-in, and implementation continuity.

    * In case the recommendations are labeled as **low impact/risk and high urgency**: The product would be a **tactical report**, which is usually consumed by operations staff and Sysadmins to solve specific issues with day-to-day operative processes and used technology.

    * In case the recommendations are labeled as **low impact/risk and low urgency**: The product would be an **operational report**, which is usually consumed by security management and is usually focused on creating policies addressing security issues, which require a considerable amount of time and organizational buy in to build, implement, and maintain.

  * Compare the resources required against the capabilities identified in the risk modeling activities and the contextual research you completed.


  *  Based upon the organizational capacity assessment, build a menu that builds upon the organizational strengths to create a path forward that provides achievable outcomes, maintains agency, and steps towards long-term difficult outcomes with high reward for the host.


  * **Implementation Matrix Development:** Create an "implementation matrix." with the urgency of the threat addressed balanced by the difficulty of implementation given available organizational capacity for the recommendations.


  * **Roadmap Development:** Identify critical vulnerabilities, with achievable recommendations that fit into threat narratives that you heard from staff during the audit to create a remediation roadmap for addressing the threats faced by the organization. Include a short description of why each recommendation (and corresponding threat) was ranked with the urgency it was assigned.


  * **Documenting Existing Successes:** Place the recommendations on a timeline that includes the existing practices of the organization to show that the remediation process is a continuation of the hosts existing in/formal security practices.

title: Roadmap Development
overview: As part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting
  organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of
  vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing
  overwhelming. An organization needs to be able to weigh their possible paths
  forward against the time lost from program activities, the cost to implement
  the threat, and the other threats that they are not addressing. Roadmapping is
  used to give the host the tools to make these decisions and provide them with
  a recommended path forward that will allow them to make immediate gains
  towards protecting themselves. The existing in/formal security practices
  captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and
  psycho-social barriers to starting new practices.

  Conexo](https://conexo.org/project/rawrr/), which proposes a structure to
  build the roadmap and create reports around it. "
