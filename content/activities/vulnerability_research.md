summary: After scanning and identifying which (if any) vulnerabilities are
  present within the software and systems of an organization, dig deeper to
  understand the impact of these vulnerabilities, possible evidence that they
  may have been exploited, and develop recommendations to remediate and avoid
  future instances of unpatched vulnerabilities.

walk_through: |
  
  After completing an automated vulnerability scan (network, system, webapp) and documenting findings, you can now move into vulnerability research:
  * Reviewing your findings by researching on public vulnerability Databases about the vulnerability that you have found.
  * Identify and enumerate risks involved for a certain vulnerability
  * Formulate a mitigation plan or recommendations
   Below is a list of some of the most common vulnerability databases:
    - [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov)
    - [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com)
    - [Rapid 7 Vulnerability & Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db)
    - [SecurityFocus BugTraq Database](https://www.securityfocus.com/bid)
    - [WPScan Vulnerability Database](https://wpvulndb.com)
    - [PacketStorm](https://packetstormsecurity.com)
    - [CVEDetails](https://www.cvedetails.com)
    - [KB CERT](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls)
    - [Skybox Security](https://www.vulnerabilitycenter.com/#search)
   Validation:
   Each of your findings, once reviewed and documented will be enough for your report. However, if you and the organization agreed to verify findings and vulnerability truly exist, you may refer to Penetration Testing resources within SAFETAG framework.

   **Expected Outputs**
   * Lists of OVAL/CVE identifiers for each possibly vulnerable service/system.
   * Examples of live exploits for vulnerabilities where possible.
   * A short write up of each vulnerability including how it was identified.
   * The cleaned up output from any tests used to identify the vulnerability.
considerations: |
  
  * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
  * Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.
title: Vulnerability Research
skills_required:
  - Research
  - Malware analysis
  - Risk Assessment
  - Vulnerability Scanning
overview: |
  
  * Explore Vulnerability Databases (OVAL, CVE, vendor advisories) for potential risks of systems and software used on servers, user devices, and online services (including the organization's website/CMS)
  * Search Exploit Databases to find examples of exploitation of possible vulnerabilities identified.
  * Explore default configurations for vulnerabilities such as default passwords or users.
recommendations: |
  * Where Windows OS is found to be consistently vulnerable and frequently
  targeted as an attack vector, you may recomend
  [HardenTools](https://github.com/securitywithoutborders/hardentools), a
  utility designed to disable a number of "features" exposed by Windows which
  are generally useless to regular users and are very commonly abused by
  attackers to execute malicious code on a victim's computer.
  * Where the organization is using Microsoft 365 for their domain and device management, consider recommending [Attack Surface Reduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/overview-attack-surface-reduction?view=o365-worldwide.)
  * Consider Patch Management and Vulerability Management tools. Mainly these are commercial paid solutions, however non-profit discounts may be available. See [Automox](https://www.automox.com) or [Flexera Vulnerability Manager](https://www.flexera.com/products/software-vulnerability-manager.html).
  * Organizations can receive ongoing vulnerability monitoring of publicly-exposed assets by Security Scorecard by applying to [Project Escher](https://securityscorecard.com/company/about-us/project-escher).
