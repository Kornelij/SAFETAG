Internews is excited to announce that we will be hosting our second virtual Organizational Security Village from **August 30-September 2, 2021**. This event will bring together security auditors, digital security trainers, and other experts and practitioners for a four-day program highlighting community-led sessions exploring organizational security.

## Virtual Village Format

Based on feedback from the community following [last yearâ€™s event](https://internews.org/?s=orgsec%20village), we will retain the same format, hosting live sessions during four consecutive days. Each session will last approximately 50 minutes with a short break in between sessions. We will share a schedule and additional information on each session prior to the event. You are invited to join as many or as few sessions as you would like!

We recognize that some may not be able to join due to timing or prior engagements. To ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute in some way, non-attributed, editable notes from each session will be made available to all those who register for the event.

## Registration and CoC

Please let us know you will be attending by registering here no later than **August 23**: <https://forms.office.com/r/YZBn5JwPuK>  We ask that you register even if you only plan to attend a few days or sessions.

***Event access details will only be shared with registered participants.***

*Please also complete the registration form if you are not able to join the live sessions but would like to review notes or contribute asynchronously.*

This event will follow the [USABLE Code of Conduct](https://usable.tools/coc/).
