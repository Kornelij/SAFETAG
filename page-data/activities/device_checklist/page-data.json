Switch to licensed software or recommended Free Open Source Software</p>\n<p><strong>If Outdated - Update Operating Systems and Other Software</strong></p>\n<p>Operating Systems and Softwares of all varieties - Windows, Mac, Linux, and others, are constantly being updated.  These updates often fix bugs, but they also protect the system from newly discovered vulnerabilities.  It can seem difficult to keep updating constantly, but this is very important to protect even non-sensitive systems.</p>\n<p><strong>If Vulnerable Software - Update Vulnerable Software</strong></p>\n<p>Many critical software components, such as Java or Adobe Flash, have many vulnerabilities and need to be aggressively updated. If there are not needed for work by the users, uninstall them</p>\n<p><strong>If No Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware Scanner - Install Anti-Virus and Anti-Maware Scanner</strong></p>\n<p>An Anti-virus and Anti-malware offer some minimal protection to the system and therefore is important to have them installed.</p>\n<p><strong>If Outdated Anti-Virus - Update Anti-Virus</strong></p>\n<p>Most AV tools automatically update, but this can sometimes get out of sync, or if the AV was a pre-installed trial system, it will stop updating after its trial period.  An out of date anti-virus is worthless. Therefore ensure that continuous udpdating of AV is done.</p>\n<p><strong>If Unencrypted Drive  - Encrypt Hard Drives</strong></p>\n<p>When possible, build-in drive encryption (Filevault on OSX, BitLockeron Windows, and LUKS on Linux) tend to offer the most seamless, user-friendly experiences. VeraCrypt offers free cross-platform drive encryption and cna also create encrypted drives which can be shared across platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>If Inactive firewall - Activate both personal and server firewall (If present)</strong></p>\n<p>Again, where present, use built-in firewalls and configure them for both office and public network options. Testing to ensure systems can still perform expected office natworking (file sharing, printing, etc.) is essential unless alternatives are created.</p>"},"summary":{"html":"<p>The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus and other security capabilities, and identifies software running on computers and its current version.

The auditor should focus on the work devices to limit scope creep, but if the office has many personal devices accessing organizational accounts/data, the auditor should share what \"red flags\" they are looking for and work in tandem with device owners and/or IT staff. For a small office, it may be possible to check every machine. For larger offices, the auditor should use a subset to get a feel for the overall security stance of user devices.</p>\n<p>As you work with staff members, also interview them about the other devices they use such as phones and tablets, and how they connect to work services - email/webmail, chat Apps, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, and website management tools.</p>\n<p>Below is a checklist to assist in checking across different platforms/versions for common security needs.</p>\n<hr>\n<section><h6 id=\"variant-os-x\">Variant: OS X</h6><ul>\n<li>OS Security Updates</li>\n</ul><p>GUI: Choose System Preferences from the Apple (ï£¿) menu, then click Software Update to check for updates</p><ul>\n<li>Firewall</li>\n</ul><p> See <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1810\">http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1810</a> for cross-version guidance</p><p>GUI: Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu, Security (10.5 and before) or Security &#x26; Privacy (10.6 and later), then the Firewall tab.</p><ul>\n<li>Anti-Virus Version</li>\n<li>User privilege</li>\n<li>Drive Encryption</li>\n</ul><p>CLI:\n<code>sudo fdesetup status</code></p><p>GUI: Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu, Security (10.5 and before) or Security &#x26; Privacy (10.6 and later), then the FileVault tab.
