(We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a passphrase that contains five or more relatively uncommon words.) The key should not contain common “phrases,” expecially from well known literature like Shakespeare or religious texts, but also should not include number sequences or phrases, especially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work, and to use unique passwords for each account.</p>\n<p>Because this becomes logistically difficult, <strong>password managers</strong> such as KeePassX or other systems are recommended.</p>\n<p>Specifically for <strong>wireless passwords</strong>, choosing a strong WPA key is one of the most important steps toward defending an organization’s network perimeter from an adversary with the ability to spend some time in the vicinity of the offices. By extension, mitigating this vulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and confidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings down even the most well-secured information systems.</p>\n<p>Because shared keys inevitably end up being written on whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the WPA key should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen frequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.</p>\n<p>As WPA3 becomes more widely adopted, upgrading your network to WPA3 authentication will provide substantial security against wireless password attacks.</p>"},"summary":{"html":"<p>Weak and \"shared\" passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of well-publicized global password breaches, \"password\" and \"12345\" remain the most popular passwords, and password re-use is common. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.</p>"},"walk_through":{"html":"<p>Adapt this survey to get a sense of how passwords are used in the organization.  Anonymous paper surveys, later destroyed, are a good way to gather this information.
