Based on this assessment, consider beginning with more informal agreements among staff which still help centralize their approach to security and improve their preventative measures and ability to respond to incidents that are easy and effective to adopt.

These situations can be related to regular operations (looking for best practices) and risks (looking for security procedures). For small and medium-sized organizations, arrange group conversations around a few specific what-if scenarios (this can be integrated into the Data Mapping or Process Mapping approaches). Discussions can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How passwords are created, used, and shared</li>\n<li>Who has access to what information (e.g. HR, finance, partners)</li>\n<li>Destruction/loss of office devices (fire, natural disaster, etc.)</li>\n<li>Lost devices (e.g. while traveling)</li>\n<li>Data breach impacting a cloud service used by the organization</li>\n<li>New people join or leave the organization</li>\n<li>Everyday communications both internally and with key sensitive partners like sources, at-risk beneficiaries, and funders if applicable</li>\n<li>\n<p>For high-risk organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Response to raids on the office or key staff homes</li>\n<li>Response to arrests of staff or key partners</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Meet with members of the organization and present to them the situations on the previous list, asking if there are some codes or agreements regarding security aspects of the situations presented, take notes of the responses and possible differences between the criteria or knowledge of the agreements.
