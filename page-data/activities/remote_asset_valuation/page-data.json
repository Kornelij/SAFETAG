However, in past audits, most groups skipped ahead and proceeded to do both steps per asset. This caused some groups to not progress as quickly as others.

Set clear times you will check-in with each group (e.g. after 5m, mid point, 5m remaining).</li>\n<li>Coordinating online takes time.

Ask each group to assign a notetaker and to discuss each point. You do not want individuals to silently complete the document. The point is to stir discussion.</li>\n<li>For the <strong>first 20-30 minutes</strong> the breakout groups should only be identifying assets and their locations.

This entails going through each asset and evaluating its sensitivity (high - red, medium - orange, low - green). Healthy discussion is encouraged.</li>\n<li>Often groups will lean towards marking everything high sensitivity, but this is not helpful when prioritizing defensive strategies.</li>\n<li>A way to support the groups and help them calibrate their ranking is by asking them to compare assets to one another. Compare two high sensitivity assets. Are they equally sensitive? Compare to another asset. Are they also equally sensitive and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Once all groups have complete the Asset Valuation Tables</strong>, regroup all staff.</li>\n<li>Depending on the size of the group, ask a team leader to highlight the top most sensitive assets identified.
