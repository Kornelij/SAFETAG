It requires careful planning, scheduling, documentation and coordination from both parties. </p>\n<p>As situations may arise during the course of the project, adherence to the activities indicated on the project plan is required. Constant communication and participation are the keys for a successful remote audit.</p>\n<p>After preparing the list in \"materials_needed\", you may first start selecting or combining different approaches in conducting remote audit.</p>\n<p>There are four different approaches you can use, depending on what resources are available, the size and structure of the organization, and which activities you are trying to facilitate remotely. Is there someone that can help as an on-site facilitator? Are video conferences realistic (given bandwidth and cost)? How does the approach you use interact with existing organizational team structures?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Approach 1: On-site facilitator</strong>: This provides the most valuable interaction, but requires a person who can take on the facilitation role on-site, while the auditor is over video chat.  The facilitator does not have to be a technical person, but should be able to manage the session, making sure that it is as inclusive and as productive as possible. Accommodates more participants per session than Approach 3 per session.</li>\n<li><strong>Approach 2, hybrid online/synchronous</strong>: This can be used with a large group of participants where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with enough time to collect and analyse responses in between.</li>\n<li><strong>Approach 3, multiple small sessions</strong>: Consists of multiple small full sessions over video chats, of no more than four participants at a time to assure inclusiveness. Suitable for medium to large groups where it is possible to conduct multiple small video chats.</li>\n<li><strong>Approach 4, hybrid offline/surveys</strong>: This leverages surveys and shorters calls or emails. It will provide less information overall, but can be used when it is not possible to meet in person, over video chat, or through a local facilitator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Planning your audit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of staff (office based, remote)</li>\n<li>Schedule (Upcoming calendar events)</li>\n<li>Availability (Can be 30min to 1hour a day/individual or can be 1 hour for a group of 4-5)</li>\n<li>Communication method (Video, email, chat)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on which area you are auditing, you may decide on using mixed approaches during the course of the audit.</p>"},"materials_needed":{"html":"<p>In preparation with the remote facilitation activity, the following materials and documentation should be considered.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication Guidelines</li>\n<li>Approved communication applications and channels (including fallback communication channels)</li>\n<li>Questionnaire, survey forms, templates (categorized)</li>\n<li>Auditing tools: Remote Desktop applications, auditing software (Lynis, Belarc Advisor)</li>\n<li>Project planning tools (Online Gantt Chart, Task Management etc)</li>\n</ul>"},"considerations":{"html":"<p>Remote facilitation, if not done securely, can expose sensitive information from both the auditor and the organization.
