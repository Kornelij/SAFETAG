An organization needs to be able to weigh their possible paths forward against the time lost from program activities, the cost to implement the threat, and the other threats that they are not addressing.  Roadmapping is used to give the host the tools to make these decisions and provide them with a recommended path forward that will allow them to make immediate gains towards protecting themselves. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.</p>"},"materials_needed":null,"considerations":{"html":"<ul>\n<li>Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The roadmap may be shared with local IT support, digital security trainers, possible funders, or other consultants in part, or in full.
