Further, the WPS system allows an attacker to work on this PIN in two parallel chunks, further reducing its security. This, like WEP, is a \"live\" attack - you have to stay connected to the network - but also like WEP, it is a guaranteed attack; your brute forcing of the WPS system will eventually (2-10 hours) allow you network access. </p>"},"walk_through":{"html":"<ul>\n<li>Find the BSSID of the target routerr</li>\n<li>Use Wash to find WPS Routers</li>\n<li>Start Reaver : estimated time: Between 2 and 10 hours</li>\n</ul>"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/activities/wps_pin_cracking","language":"en","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","fr"],"defaultLanguage":"en","generateDefaultLanguagePage":false,"routed":false,"originalPath":"/activities/wps_pin_cracking","path":"/activities/wps_pin_cracking"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
