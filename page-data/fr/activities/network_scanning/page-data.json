For example, if the open port is 80, 8080, or 443, it's supposed to be open for a web server, so you can try to browse it by pasting the IP address in your browser address bar.</p><p>If it's for SSH (port 22), try to log into it through SSH.  If the service isn't supposed to be running in the identified device, you can run a scan of the open ports and request service banners, and/or try to telnet directly to the IP:port to identify what service they are connected to.\nTo identify what a port might be used for, look at the complete list at <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml\">IANA.org</a>. Using nmap's banner scripts will also reveal what the service reports itself as (for example, you can run ssh, usually port 22, on port 443, usually https). Once you have identified what service that port might be used for, always check that that service is actually running in the machine and that the user or sysadmin is aware of it.</p><p>In general, these are ports that might be open in a server:</p><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Port</th>\n<th>Service</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>FTP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>SSH</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>Telnet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>SMTP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>53</td>\n<td>DNS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>HTTP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>110</td>\n<td>POP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>139</td>\n<td>SMB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>143</td>\n<td>IMAP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>194</td>\n<td>IRC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>443</td>\n<td>HTTPS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>465</td>\n<td>SMTP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>530</td>\n<td>CUPS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>587</td>\n<td>SMTP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>667</td>\n<td>IRC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>993</td>\n<td>IMAP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>995</td>\n<td>POP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1900</td>\n<td>port authority</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3306</td>\n<td>MySQL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6881 to 6889</td>\n<td>Torrent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6969</td>\n<td>Torrent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8080</td>\n<td>HTTP</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><p><strong>IoT Devices</strong></p><p>IoT (Internet of Things) is getting popular in use because of it's ease of use and ability to address certain needs. (e.g. use of IP camera instead of CCTV). As classes of network appliances become common, additional exercises (such as the VOIP assessment) can be created.  For others, it is still worth conducting a basic assessment to determine what security implications network-connected devices may have.</p><p>In the course of network scanning, watch for devices without clear operating system identification (from nmap/zenmap), and/or devices registering as Linux or unknown (particularly if there are not Linux users or servers), and use hostnames and MAC address lookups <a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html\">Wireshark</a>, <a href=\"https://macvendors.com/\">MACVendors</a> for \"hints\".</p><p>Follow up on these devices with more intensive, specific scans to positively identify them, and/or follow up with staff to help physically locate the devices. Some devices, such as Smart TVs, may not even be normally thought of as devices worth considering, but if they are connected to the work network, they can add vulnerabilities.</p><p>Once any IoT devices have been identified, follow up with research as to their current and possible patch level/software update, what vulnerabilities they may have even if fully updated, and if there have been any known attacks against the platform.  Check their configuration to see if they are accessible from the Internet (directly, via UPnP, or via an external service that the device connects out to). Check to see that default passwords have been updated, and any service-connected devices have strong, unique and not-previously-breached passwords.</p><p>If there are un-mitigateable vulnerabilities, consider suggesting removing the IoT device from the network or creating a separate network disconnected from organizational resources for non-work devices.</p><p><strong>Windows / SMB Networks</strong></p><ul>\n<li>SNMP</li>\n<li>SMB</li>\n<li>NetBIOS</li>\n<li>Shared Folders</li>\n<li>RDP</li>\n<li>Telnet</li>\n<li>Password Sniffing</li>\n</ul><p>You can use smbtree to request a list of all smb network device names and nmblookup to connect them to their IP address.</p><p>Unsigned NTLM authentication messages vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attack on SMB file servers.

However, it is important that you seek approval or any written document that proves you have the authority to scan your target organization along with its web resources and services.</p><p>External network scans are different for local network scans. This is because you are scanning devices that are publicly available, and can be done remotely outside the organization's premise. If your auditee agreed to have their public facing machines scanned, keep in mind that you need to consider asking your auditee for whitelisting options for shunning IDS/IPS, firewalls and other blocking mechanisms during your scan.

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts\".
